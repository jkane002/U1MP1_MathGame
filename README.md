Unit 1 Mini Project - Math Game for The Coding School

**Project Name:** Math Game

**Project Description:** This project is a simple math addition game where the user adds two numbers together. If the answer is correct, they receive a congratulations post. If not, the app prompts them with the correct response. 

This project serves as an introduction to programming in Android Studio. There will be many topics covered in this mini-project but no need to worry! The purpose of this project is to simply introduce students to how Android Studio works very generally speaking; the subsequent lessons will go into further detail of each component of Android Studio, such as how to design buttons, create activities, etc.
